#### This is one of the first project t was I used API with React.js. In this project, the user enters a word and sees the mean and phonetic of that word also listens pronunciation of the word. This project was completed using HTML, CSS, Tailwind, React.js and my purpose in making this project was to experience the basic Tailwind and React.js features. <br> <br> <br>
